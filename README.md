# ZarytskyiSergii-Restaurant-Dashboard-Webpage
Hi Jean!
I have completed the assignment and I am attaching the link to the gh-pages where I have hosted the web application.
I have implemented all the functionality described and added some features that I think complement the basic functionality:
 - for example, I added a form for manager authorization with simple login and password validation;
 - in the footer, I placed a link to the address in Google maps and made phone and email links;
 - I added a favicon for beauty;
I also tested the web application with the built-in Lighthouse tool and got quite high marks (I'm attaching the screenshot);
 - made an adaptive markup for correct display on devices of different sizes
I hope this is enough to pass this test
